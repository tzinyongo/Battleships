#BattleShips 
Mimicked the game battleship
Utilized polymorphism, by creating 6 classes and having each inherit their respective parents. Utilized several methods; such as attack that allows users to attack shipis, one that sinks the ship if the number of attacks equal the ships length; one that checks if ship is located at a specific index, etc…
that intialated a 10X10 grid to allow each player to track attacked made against the opposing player. If a plater attacks a location and they miss it will be noted with an x and if they hit it will be denoted as ‘hit’
