#BattleShips 
Mimicked the game Battleship
Utilized polymorphism by creating 6 classes and having each inherit their respective parents. Utilized several methods, such as an attack that allows users to attack ships, one that sinks the ship if the number of attacks equals the length of the ship, one that checks if the ship is located at a specific index, etc…
That initiated a 10X10 grid to allow each player to track attacks made against the opposing player. If a player attacks a location and misses, it will be noted with an x, and if they hit, it will be denoted as ‘hit.’
